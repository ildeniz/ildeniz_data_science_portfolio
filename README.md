# My data science portfolio
If you are reading this, it means that you have already obtained my CV and want to check out my projects.
These projects were part of my learning process from university lectures of my M.Sc. program and other various sources. At some point, I decided to polish and upgrade them for portfolio purposes, and I prepared them as easy to follow and digest.
I hope the content of this repository will be helpful to you to have an idea about my capabilities and technical skill level.

Critics and hints to develop improvements are always welcome.

Have fun ^_^ -ildeniz

# [Project 1: Glass Classification](https://github.com/ildeniz/ML-2022-001-Glass_classification) 
The purpose of this study is to define the type of a glass depending on the given features.

# [Project 3: Forecasting Store Sales Through Time Series Analysis.](https://github.com/ildeniz/ML-2022-003-Forecasting_Store_Sales_Through_Time_Series_Analysis) 
This notebook is influenced by [Rossman Store Sales competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales) that held in Kaggle and ran from 30th of September to 12th of December, 2015. The aim of the competition was to forecast the sales for individual stores of (almost) 7 weeks interval between 01.08.2015-17.09.2015. Rossmann provided a training data set consistent of daily sales data of 1115 stores located in Germany from 01.01.2013 to 31.07.2015 and data on competitors for supplement.

I am going to apply my current knowledge on this data set and I am planning to update it as my knowledge on the field.

The data set is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/data)\
