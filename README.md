# My data science portfolio
The purpose of this repository is to give an idea to the reader about my technical skill level on data science applications .

These projects were part of my learning process from university lectures of my M.Sc. program and other various sources. At some point, I decided to polish and upgrade them for portfolio purposes, and I prepared them as easy to follow and digest.

# [Project 1: Forecasting Store Sales Through Time Series Analysis.](https://github.com/ildeniz/ML-2022-003-Forecasting_Store_Sales_Through_Time_Series_Analysis) 
This project is influenced by [Rossman Store Sales competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales) that held in Kaggle and ran from 30th of September to 12th of December, 2015.
The data set is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/data)

* Developed a hybrid model to predict the 1115 Rossmann stores' average daily sales for the next 60 days.
* Engineered features through given data sets to eliminate trend, seasonality and cycle components to make the time series stationary and the predictions accurate.
* Root Mean Square Percentage Error: 0.1774

TODO:
  * Optimize hybrid model of Linear and Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
  * Built a client facing API using flask/django/etc.

# [Project 2: Glass Classification [**This project is being updated**]](https://github.com/ildeniz/ML-2022-001-Glass_classification) 

The purpose of this project is to define the type of a glass depending on the given features. 

The motivation behind the glass classification is given by the contributor as;
>The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by
criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left
can be used as evidenceâ€¦if it is correctly identified!

The data set used in this work is obtained from;
