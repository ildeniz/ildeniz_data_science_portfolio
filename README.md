# My data science portfolio
If you are reading this, it means that you have already obtained my CV and want to check out my projects.
These projects were part of my learning process from university lectures of my M.Sc. program and other various sources. At some point, I decided to polish and upgrade them for portfolio purposes, and I prepared them as easy to follow and digest.
I hope the content of this repository will be helpful to you to have an idea about my capabilities and technical skill level.

Critics and hints to develop improvements are always welcome.

Have fun ^_^ -ildeniz
